This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 13 December 1988. For the Council The President K. PAPANAYOTOU (1) OJ No L 133, 21. 5. 1973, p. 2. DECISION No 1/88 OF THE EEC-CYPRUS ASSOCIATION COUNCIL of 21 November 1988 amending, as a consequence of the introduction of the harmonized system, Protocol 2 concerning the definition of the concept of ´originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation\nTHE ASSOCIATION COUNCIL, Having regard to the Agreement creating an Association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus, signed on 19 December 1972, Having regard to the Protocol concerning the definition of the concept of ´originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation, and in particular Article 25 thereof, Whereas the origin rules contained in the said Protocol are based on the use of the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature;\nwhereas the Customs Cooperation Council approved the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (hereinafter referred to as the ´harmonized system') on 14 June 1983;\nwhereas it is the intention that, as from 1 January 1988, the harmonized system will replace the current nomenclature for the purposes of international trade;\nwhereas it is therefore necessary to adapt the rules of origin contained in the Protocol so that they are based on the use of the harmonized system;\nWhereas, in the light of experience, the presentation of the origin rules could be improved by grouping all the exceptions to the basic change of heading rule into one List and by providing detailed guidance on how it should be interpreted, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1 In the last subparagraph of Article 1 of Protocol 2, ´in List C in Annex IV' is replaced by ´in Annex II'. Article 2 Article 3 of the Protocol is replaced by the following:\n´Article 3 1. The expressions ´´chapters'' and ´´headings'' used in this Protocol shall mean the chapters and the headings (four digit codes) used in the Nomenclature which makes up the ´´Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System'' (hereinafter referred to as the harmonized system or HS).The expression ´´classified'' shall refer to the classification of a product or material under a particular heading.\n2. For the purposes of Article 1, non-originating materials are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the product obtained is classified in a heading which is different from those in which all the non-originating materials used in its manufacture are classified, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4. 3. For a product mentioned in columns 1 and 2 of the List in Annex III, the conditions set out in column 3 for the product concerned must be fulfilled instead of the rule in paragraph 2. 4. For the purpose of implementing Article 1, the following shall always be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating product, whether or not there is a change of heading:\n(a) operations to ensure the preservation of merchandise in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);\n(b)simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;\n(c)i(i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of consignments;\n(ii)simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc.\n, and all other simple packaging operations;\n(d)affixing marks, labels or other like distinguish- ing signs on products or their packaging;\n(e)simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds, where one or more components of the mixture do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating;\n(f)simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article;\n(g)a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);\n(h)slaughter of animals.\n'. Article 3 Article 4 of the Protocol is replaced by the following:\n´Article 41. The term ´´value'' in the List in Annex III shall mean the customs value at the time of the import of the non-originating materials used or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the materials in the territory concerned.\nWhere the value of the originating materials used needs to be established, this paragraph shall be applied ´´mutatis mutandis''. 2. The term ´´ex works price'' in the List in Annex III shall mean the ex works price of the product obtained minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported.\n'. Article 4 Article 6 of the Protocol is hereby amended as follows:\n1. In paragraph 2, ´Article 3 (3)' is replaced by ´Article 3 (4)', and ´Brussels Nomenclature' by ´harmonized system'. 2.The following paragraph is added:\n´4. Sets within the meaning of General Rule 3 of the harmonized system shall be regarded as originating when all component articles are originating products.\nNevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating articles, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating provided that the value of the non-originating articles does not exceed 15 % of the ex works price of the set.\n'. Article 5 1. Annexes I, II and III to this Decision replace Annexes I, II, III and IV to Protocol 2. 2. Annexes V and VI are renumbered IV and V. Article 6 1. Products which were exported before 1 January 1988, accompanied by a movement certificate EUR 1 or form EUR 2, shall be considered as originating under the rules in force on 1 January 1988. 2. Movement certificates EUR 1 or forms EUR 2 issued or made out before 1 January 1988 under the rules in force before that date shall be accepted up to and including 31 May 1988 according to the rules in force when they were issued.\n3. Articles 19 and 20 of the Protocol shall apply in the case of goods exported before 1 January 1988 and retrospective or duplicate movement certificates may be issued under the rules in force before that date.\nArticle 7 Decision No 1/79 is replaced by this Decision.\nArticle 8 This Decision shall apply from 1 January 1989.

For the period 1 October to 31 December 1994, the maximum number referred to in Article 13 (4) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 shall be 48 555 head of young male bovine animals for fattening comprising:\n(a) 6 315 of a live weight of not more than 300 kilograms per head and subject to a 65 % reduction in the levy; and\n(b) 42 240 of a live weight of 160 to 300 kilograms per head, originating in and coming from Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania, Slovenia or Bulgaria and subject to a 75 % reduction in the levy.\n2. The reductions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be in respect of the levy applicable on the day of acceptance of the declaration of release for free circulation.\n3. The quantities referred to in paragraph 1 shall be allocated as follows:\n""" ID="1">5 480> ID="2">835"> ID="1">36 640> ID="2">5 600">\n4.

In the information referred to in Article 15 (4) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80, Member States shall specify the category of live weight and the origin of the products in the case referred to in the second indent of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4.\n7. Of the number of head reserved for Italy and Greece for each category notwithstanding Article 9 (1) (a) and Article 15 (6) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80:\n(a) import licences relating to 80 % of the number of head referred to above may be allocated directly to importers who provide proof of having imported animals qualifying under this scheme during the last three calendar years. Numbers covered by licences shall be allocated in proportion to the number of head imported in the three years concerned;\n(b) import licences relating to the remaining 20 % may be allocated directly to operators entered in a public register in a Member State who can prove that they exported/imported in 1993 at least 50 live animals falling within CN code 0102 90 excluding imports under the falling Commission Regulations:\n- (EEC) No 2753/92 (9),\n- (EEC) No 3806/92 (10),\n- (EEC) No 733/93 (11),\n- (EEC) No 1622/93 (12), and\n- (EEC) No 2657/93 (13).\nThe import licence application must be submitted in Italy or in Greece.\n8. The proof referred to in paragraph 7 shall be provided by the customs document of release for free circulation or export document.\nArticle 2\n1. As regards the quantities referred to in Article 1 (7) (b) applications for import licences shall:\n(a) relate to a number equal to or more than 50 head; and\n(b) relate to a quantity not exceeding 10 % of the quantities available except where the said 10 % results in a figure of less than 50 head; in the latter case the maximum figure shall also be 50 head.\n2. In cases where applications for import licences state quantities in excess of those provided for by this Regulation, those applications shall only be considered within the limits of the said quantities.\n3. Numbers shall be allocated in proportion to the number of head for which application is made by the operators eligible. If, because of the number for which application is made, the percentage reduction results in fewer than 20 head per import licence, the Member States shall, by drawing lots, be allocated licences covering 20 head.\nArticle 3\nNotwithstanding Article 8 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (14), the levy shall be collected in full in respect of quantities in excess of those stated on the import licence.\nArticle 4\nNotwithstanding Article 9 (1) (e) and (f) of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80, the terms \'220 kg\' and \'Yugoslavia and/or Poland and/or Hungary\' laid down in those provisions shall be read respectively as \'160 kg\' and \'Hungary and/or Poland and/or the Czech Republic and/or the Slovak Republic and/or Romania and/or Slovenia and/or Bulgaria\'.\nArticle 5\nFor the purposes of Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80, all applications from one applicant, which relate to the same category of weight and the same rate of reduction in the levy, shall be treated as one application.\nArticle 6\nThe security for the import licence shall be lodged at the time of issue of the said licence.\nArticle 7\nThree weeks at the latest after import of the livestock referred to in this Regulation, importers shall inform the competent authorities which issued the import licences, of the number and origin of the animals imported. Those authorities shall forward that information to the Commission at the beginning of each month.\nArticle 8\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the

13 November 1984 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (2), and in particular Article 5 (2) thereof,\nWhereas Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 provides that the grading of pig carcases must be determined by estimating the content of lean meat in accordance with statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase; whereas the authorization of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment; whereas this tolerance has been defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases (3);\nWhereas the Government of Portugal has requested the Commission to authorize the use of three methods for grading pig carcases on its territory and has submitted the information required in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85; whereas an examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorizing the said grading methods are fulfilled;\nWhereas no modification of the apparatus or grading method may be authorized except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe use of the following methods is hereby authorized for grading pig carcases pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 in Portugal:\n- the apparatus termed 'Intrascope (Optical Probe)' and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 1 of the Annex,\n- the apparatus termed 'Fat-O-Meater (FOM)' and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 2 of the Annex,\n- the apparatus termed 'Hennessy Grading Probe (HGP II)' and assessment methods related thereto, details of which are given in Part 3 of the Annex.\nArticle 2\nModifications of the apparatus or of the assessment methods shall not be authorized.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic.\nDone at Brussels, 16 December 1992.", 'labels': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
